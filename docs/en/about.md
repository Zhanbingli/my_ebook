# About

> Medicine is science in action; AI is more than tooling—it reshapes cognition. This project weaves both into a validated, reusable knowledge system.

## What we are building

- **Resilient knowledge**: Git-powered, versioned content that keeps clinical and AI updates transparent.
- **Codified practice**: Clinical reasoning frameworks, evidence summaries, and case retrospectives ready for teaching.
- **Intelligent assistance**: Working notes on how large language models augment research, diagnosis, and learning.

## Principles

| Value | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **Responsible innovation** | Ethics-first adoption of AI in medical decision making |
| **Shared wisdom** | Invite clinicians, engineers, and researchers to co-review and co-create |
| **Verification first** | Every claim is traceable to data, literature, or field practice |

## Who this is for

- Healthcare professionals: clinicians, medical trainees, translational researchers
- Builders: ML engineers, product teams, and startups in digital health
- Educators: curriculum designers, academic mentors, and continuing education leaders

## Content tracks

1. **Clinics & Research** — Evidence distillations, workflow retrospectives, and emergent trend scanning
2. **Intelligent Tooling** — Dialogue logs, automation snippets, and model evaluation field notes
3. **Knowledge Operations** — Course design frameworks, collaboration playbooks, and governance guides

## Ways to contribute

- Submit issues/PRs with case studies, literature, or translation improvements
- Share your cross-disciplinary experiments to expand the knowledge graph
- Amplify the project so more domain experts can review and participate

Your voice matters—help us combine the warmth of clinical care with the imagination of modern computing.
